How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I think this is one of those skills that takes time to master. As long as there is an open line of communication with the end-user, all types of changes can be implemented by way of many small and simple releases. User stories helps with streamlining client needs by asking the questions, "Who?," "What?," and "Why?."

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

After learning about Agile, I feel well-equipped with the tools needed to enhance my understanding of project management in various situations. In development, organization is crucial, and Agile provides the means to stay organized while being flexible and adaptable. Development teams focus more on value-based development and are not confined by strict time constraints, which helps consistently deliver on end-user goals. I plan to incorporate software tools like Azure, Jira, and GitHub into my future projects. Additionally, daily stand-up meetings and planning poker have become favorites in my developer toolkit. Agile helps alleviate the overwhelming feeling of large development projects by breaking them down into smaller tasks, ensuring a stable product by the end. As the saying goes, "Slow and steady wins the race!"

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

When I was at a full-stack development bootcamp, I learned the importance of teamwork and open communication. In a team with diverse personalities and opinions, it's crucial to remember that everyone shares the same goal: delivering a quality product. Agile emphasizes flexibility, and developers must be adaptable, open to new ideas, and willing to acknowledge differing opinions. As the team lead, I ensured that every member had a voice, and each idea was considered, fostering trust and strengthening relationships. Agile's focus on collaboration and flexibility promotes personal development, enabling team members to contribute and grow together.
